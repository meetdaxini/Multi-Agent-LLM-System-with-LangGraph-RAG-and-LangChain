# ### Tree Constrution
#
# The clustering approach in tree construction includes a few interesting ideas.
#
# **GMM (Gaussian Mixture Model)**
#
# - Model the distribution of data points across different clusters
# - Optimal number of clusters by evaluating the model's Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC)
#
# **UMAP (Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection)**
#
# - Supports clustering
# - Reduces the dimensionality of high-dimensional data
# - UMAP helps to highlight the natural grouping of data points based on their similarities
#
# **Local and Global Clustering**
#
# - Used to analyze data at different scales
# - Both fine-grained and broader patterns within the data are captured effectively
#
# **Thresholding**
#
# - Apply in the context of GMM to determine cluster membership
# - Based on the probability distribution (assignment of data points to â‰¥ 1 cluster)

# Code for GMM and thresholding is from Sarthi et al, as noted in the below two sources:
