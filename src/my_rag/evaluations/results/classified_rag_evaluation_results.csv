1. Most lncRNAs are spliced (98%), but they tend to have fewer exons than protein-coding genes. 42% of lncRNA transcripts have only two exons, compared to 6% of protein-coding genes.

2. LncRNA exons are slightly longer than protein-coding exons on average (149 bp vs 132 bp).

3. LncRNA introns are longer than protein-coding introns on average (2280 bp vs 1602 bp).

4. Over 25% of lncRNA genes show evidence of alternative splicing, with at least two different transcript isoforms.

5. The vast majority of lncRNA introns are flanked by canonical splice sites (GT/AG), similar to protein-coding genes.

6. However, lncRNAs show lower splicing completion rates compared to mRNAs in chromatin-associated and nuclear fractions, suggesting they are often spliced later or sometimes not spliced at all.

7. Some well-known lncRNAs like AIRN and KCNQ1OT1 remain predominantly unspliced.

In summary, while most lncRNAs undergo splicing, they tend to have simpler splicing patterns than mRNAs (fewer exons) and may be spliced less efficiently or later in the RNA processing pathway. Some lncRNAs can remain unspliced.",correct,correct

Specifically, the passage states:

""The FDA approved in November 2010 denosumab for the prevention of SREs in men with metastatic CRPC and bone metastases.""

SREs refers to skeletal-related events. So Denosumab (brand name Xgeva) was approved by the FDA in 2010 for preventing bone complications in men with metastatic CRPC that has spread to the bones.",correct,correct
mixedbread-ai_mxbai-embed-large-v1,,anthropic.claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620-v1_0,PubMed filtered Dataset,Is Hirschsprung disease a mendelian or a multifactorial disorder?,"Coding sequence mutations in RET, GDNF, EDNRB, EDN3, and SOX10 are involved in the development of Hirschsprung disease. The majority of these genes was shown to be related to Mendelian syndromic forms of Hirschsprung's disease, whereas the non-Mendelian inheritance of sporadic non-syndromic Hirschsprung disease proved to be complex; involvement of multiple loci was demonstrated in a multiplicative model.","Based on the information provided in the context, Hirschsprung disease (HSCR) appears to be a multifactorial disorder with a complex genetic etiology, rather than a simple Mendelian disorder. Key points that support this:

1. The context states that HSCR ""has a complex genetic etiology with several genes being described as associated with either isolated or syndromic forms.""

2. It mentions that both rare variants (RVs) and common variants (CVs) in the RET gene contribute to HSCR in a ""multifactorial nature.""

3. The study analyzed both RET rare variants and common variants, indicating multiple genetic factors are involved.

4. It states there is ""differential contributions of its rare and common, coding and noncoding mutations to the multifactorial nature of this pathology.""

5. The disease shows variable expressivity and incomplete penetrance, with sex-dependent penetrance mentioned.

6. Environmental factors may also play a role, as evidenced by the sporadic occurrence in most cases.

So while certain genes like RET play a major role, HSCR appears to result from a combination of multiple genetic and potentially environmental factors, fitting the profile of a complex multifactorial disorder rather than a single-gene Mendelian condition. The interplay between rare and common variants further supports its multifactorial nature.",partially,partially_correct

Specifically:

1. The study measured RANKL levels in the culture medium of osteoblasts using ELISA, indicating RANKL is secreted into the medium.

2. Table II shows RANKL levels detected in the culture medium of osteoblasts in both single-culture and co-culture conditions. 

3. The text states: ""An increased RANKL/OPG ratio secreted by co-cultured osteoblasts compared with single-cultured was identified by ELISA analysis of cell culture medium (Table II).""

So the study directly measured secreted RANKL in the cell culture medium, demonstrating that RANKL is indeed secreted from the osteoblast cells. The ability to detect RANKL in the medium indicates it is released/secreted by the cells.",correct,correct

Key points:

1. HER2, the target of trastuzumab, is overexpressed in 20-30% of prostate cancers and up to 78% of androgen-independent prostate cancers. 

2. HER2 overexpression is associated with more aggressive prostate cancer and poorer prognosis.

3. In preclinical studies, 212Pb-trastuzumab showed significant therapeutic effects against prostate cancer xenografts:
   - Reduced tumor growth by 60-80%
   - Reduced lymph node metastasis 
   - Prolonged survival of tumor-bearing mice
   - Did not cause significant systemic toxicity

4. The authors conclude that ""212Pb-trastuzumab could be an effective modality for therapy against advanced human prostate cancer.""

5. However, studies with trastuzumab alone (without radiolabeling) showed limited therapeutic responses in prostate cancer models and clinical trials.

In summary, while trastuzumab alone may have limited efficacy, radiolabeled versions like 212Pb-trastuzumab show promise as a potential treatment for advanced prostate cancer in preclinical studies. Further clinical investigation would be needed to determine its efficacy in patients.",correct,correct

1. The text states that ""Panx1 is fully N-glycosylated and transported to the cell membrane"".

2. Figure 3A shows that mouse Panx1 (mPanx1) and zebrafish Panx1 isoforms (drPanx1a and drPanx1b) were ""localized in the plasma membrane 48 h post transfection"".

3. It mentions that ""drPanx1a was mainly found in the cell membrane"".

4. The distribution of Panx1 constructs by confocal imaging is described as ""consistent with previous reports demonstrating a plasma membrane expression for Panx1"".

5. Panx1 is described as forming ""unopposed membrane channels"" in the plasma membrane.

So in summary, the evidence consistently indicates that Pannexin1 is primarily localized to and functions at the plasma membrane of cells.",correct,correct

Extended release pyridotsygmine and novel acetylcholinesterase inhibitors inhibitors with oral antisense oligonucleotides are being studied.,"Based on the context provided, the main acetylcholinesterase inhibitor used for treatment of myasthenia gravis is:

Pyridostigmine bromide

The passage states that ""Pyridostigmine bromide is the most commonly used drug"" for symptomatic treatment of myasthenia gravis. 

It also mentions that other acetylcholinesterase inhibitors like neostigmine are rarely used due to poorer pharmacodynamic profiles and tolerability compared to pyridostigmine.

So in summary:

- Pyridostigmine bromide is the primary acetylcholinesterase inhibitor used
- Neostigmine is sometimes used but much less commonly than pyridostigmine
- Other acetylcholinesterase inhibitors are not specifically named but are implied to be rarely used

The passage focuses on pyridostigmine as the main acetylcholinesterase inhibitor treatment for myasthenia gravis.",correct,correct

""Importantly, we demonstrate for the first time that the NOTCH3 ectodomain is able to interact with ectodomains of NOTCH1 and NOTCH4, which are also expressed in the vascular wall.""

So NOTCH1, NOTCH3, and NOTCH4 are explicitly mentioned as different mammalian Notch receptor isoforms.

1. Progressive external ophthalmoplegia (PEO) associated with multiple mitochondrial DNA deletions can be caused by recessive mutations in POLG.

2. The clinical phenotype of recessive PEO patients with POLG mutations is quite heterogeneous, but common features include:
- PEO 
- Axonal sensory neuropathy
- Variable associated features like sensory ataxia, cardiomyopathy, retinopathy, hearing loss, thalamic lesions, muscle dystrophy, facial diplegia, dysarthria and dysphagia.

3. The paper reports a family with features resembling mitochondrial neurogastrointestinal encephalomyopathy (MNGIE), including severe gastrointestinal symptoms, but caused by novel POLG mutations rather than the typical TP mutations seen in MNGIE. 

4. This expands the clinical spectrum associated with recessive POLG mutations to include MNGIE-like presentations.

5. The paper notes that leukoencephalopathy, which is common in MNGIE caused by TP mutations, has not been reported in patients with POLG mutations.

In summary, the main mitochondrial diseases attributed to POLG mutations based on this context are forms of PEO with variable associated symptoms, as well as MNGIE-like presentations without leukoencephalopathy. The phenotypic spectrum appears to be quite broad.",partially,partially_correct

- miR-100 was consistently reported as down-regulated in 4 studies. 

The authors validated these 5 miRNAs in clinical samples using qRT-PCR and confirmed their dysregulation in epithelial ovarian cancer tissues compared to controls.

The review concludes that these five most consistently differentially expressed miRNAs may provide clues for potential biomarkers in epithelial ovarian cancer, though further validation studies are needed to confirm their clinical significance and roles in ovarian cancer progression.",partially,partially_correct

4. The coSI (co-transcriptional splicing index) values for lncRNA exons are described as ""dramatically lower than those of coding exons"", indicating less efficient splicing.

5. Even in the nuclear polyA+ fraction, lncRNA exons show lower splicing completion compared to mRNA exons.

So in summary, while lncRNAs can be spliced, they tend to undergo splicing less efficiently and later in the transcription process compared to mRNAs, with some lncRNAs potentially remaining unspliced.

3. The study analyzed both rare and common RET variants, finding that they seem to ""act in a synergistic way leading to HSCR phenotype.""

4. The disease shows variable expressivity and incomplete penetrance, with sex-dependent penetrance and male predominance.

5. While some cases are familial, most are sporadic, which is more consistent with a multifactorial etiology.

6. Multiple genes and pathways are implicated, including RET, EDNRB, and others involved in neural crest cell development.

7. Environmental factors likely also play a role, as is typical for multifactorial disorders.

2. It states that the ""RANKL/OPG ratio secreted by osteoblasts was decreased by adipocyte stimulation"", directly indicating that RANKL is secreted by osteoblasts. 

3. The OPG/RANKL/RANK system is described as regulating bone metabolism, with RANKL binding to RANK on other cells to promote osteoclastogenesis. This implies RANKL must be secreted to interact with RANK on other cells.

4. The passage notes that ""adipocyte-secreted cytokines affected the OPG/RANKL/RANK trail system"", again suggesting RANKL is a secreted factor in this system.

So in summary, the context clearly indicates that RANKL is secreted from cells, particularly osteoblasts, as part of its role in regulating bone metabolism.",correct,correct

Key points:

1. HER2 is implicated in the transition of prostate cancer to androgen independence, making it a potential target for therapy.

2. Trastuzumab has shown some efficacy in preclinical studies:
   - It was effective in androgen-independent prostate tumor xenografts when combined with paclitaxel.
   - It potentiated the antitumor effects of docetaxel in prostate cancer xenografts.

3. However, clinical trials of trastuzumab for prostate cancer have failed to demonstrate efficacy:
   - Trials with unselected patients did not show benefit.
   - Lack of patient stratification based on HER2 expression was suggested as a possible reason for failure.

4. Detecting HER2 expression in prostate cancer metastases remains challenging, making it difficult to identify patients who may benefit.

5. The context notes that clinical trials ""failed to demonstrate their efficacy"" for trastuzumab in prostate cancer.

In conclusion, while there is some preclinical evidence supporting potential use, clinical trials have not yet demonstrated clear efficacy of trastuzumab for prostate cancer treatment.

1. Progressive external ophthalmoplegia (PEO) - Both autosomal dominant and autosomal recessive forms of PEO can be caused by POLG mutations.

2. A condition mimicking mitochondrial neurogastrointestinal encephalomyopathy (MNGIE) - The report describes patients with features resembling MNGIE who were found to have POLG mutations rather than the typical TP mutations seen in MNGIE.

3. Conditions with variable features including:
- Axonal sensory neuropathy
- Sensory ataxia  
- Cardiomyopathy
- Retinopathy
- Sensorineural hearing loss
- Thalamic lesions
- Muscle dystrophy
- Facial diplegia
- Dysarthria 
- Dysphagia

The report notes that recessive POLG mutations can cause a heterogeneous clinical phenotype with these various features, in contrast to the more homogeneous presentation of MNGIE caused by TP mutations.

The key point is that POLG mutations can cause a spectrum of mitochondrial disorders, with PEO being a common feature but associated with variable other symptoms. The report expands this spectrum to include a MNGIE-like presentation as well.",partially,partially_correct

",Run `gradio run.py` in the terminal.,"To run a Gradio Blocks app in reload mode using a Python IDE, you can follow these steps:

1. Save your Gradio Blocks code in a Python file, for example ""run.py"".

2. Instead of running the file with the regular Python command, use the ""gradio"" command in the terminal:

   ```
   gradio run.py
   ```

3. This will launch the app in reload mode. Gradio will watch the directory where your file is located and automatically reload the app when you make changes to the code.

Key points to remember:

- Gradio looks for a Blocks/Interface demo named ""demo"" by default. If you used a different name, you need to specify it:

   ```
   gradio run.py my_demo_name
   ```

- The reload mode does not detect parameters passed to the launch() method, so things like auth or show_error settings won't be applied.

- You can pass command line arguments to your app if needed:

   ```
   gradio run.py --some_arg value
   ```

- By default, UTF-8 encoding is used. If you need a different encoding, specify it like this:

   ```
   gradio run.py --encoding cp1252
   ```

This reload mode allows you to focus on writing your code while the Gradio demo refreshes automatically, making the development process faster and more convenient.",correct,correct

","FSDP is developed for distributed training of large pretrained models up to 1T parameters by sharding the model parameters, gradients, and optimizer states across data parallel processes.","Fully Sharded Data Parallel (FSDP) is a distributed training technique developed for training very large models, with the following key purposes:

1. Memory efficiency: FSDP shards (splits) model parameters, gradients, and optimizer states across multiple GPUs. This allows training models that are too large to fit on a single GPU.

2. Scaling to larger models: By distributing the model across GPUs, FSDP enables training of models with billions or even trillions of parameters.

3. Improved performance: FSDP can improve training speed compared to regular data parallel training for very large models.

4. CPU offloading: FSDP can offload sharded model parameters to CPU memory, further increasing the maximum model size that can be trained.

5. Flexibility: FSDP allows configuring the level of sharding and other optimizations to balance memory usage and performance.

6. Ease of use: FSDP aims to be relatively easy to use compared to other model parallelism techniques, requiring minimal code changes in many cases.

   - Splitting text into tokens (words, subwords, or characters)
   - Converting tokens to numeric IDs that can be used as model inputs

2. They implement different tokenization algorithms like WordPiece, BPE, Unigram etc. which determine how text is split into tokens. This affects the vocabulary size and how well the model can handle unseen words.

3. They keep track of the alignment between the original text and tokenized outputs, allowing mapping from generated tokens back to the input text.

4. They handle adding special tokens (like [CLS], [SEP]) and other post-processing steps needed for specific model architectures.

5. They provide methods to encode text into model inputs and decode model outputs back into readable text.

6. They manage the vocabulary - the mapping between tokens and their numeric IDs.

1. Most lncRNAs are spliced (98%), but they tend to have fewer exons than protein-coding genes. 42% of lncRNA transcripts have only two exons, compared to 6% of protein-coding genes.

2. LncRNA exons are slightly longer than protein-coding exons, but lncRNA introns are longer than protein-coding introns. Overall, lncRNA transcripts tend to be shorter than protein-coding transcripts due to having fewer exons.

3. Over 25% of lncRNA genes show evidence of alternative splicing, with at least two different transcript isoforms per gene locus.

4. LncRNAs use canonical splice sites (GT/AG) similar to protein-coding genes. Some lncRNAs even contain U12 introns.

5. However, lncRNAs show lower levels of co-transcriptional splicing compared to protein-coding genes. Their splicing is often completed later or post-transcriptionally.

6. Some well-known lncRNAs like AIRN and KCNQ1OT1 may remain predominantly unspliced.

7. As a class, lncRNAs have lower splicing completion indices compared to mRNAs, both in chromatin-associated RNA and nuclear polyadenylated RNA fractions.

6. Some HSCR cases lack identified RET mutations, suggesting other genes or factors are involved.

7. Environmental factors are not ruled out as potentially contributing.

So while RET is a major gene involved, HSCR does not follow simple Mendelian inheritance patterns and appears to result from a combination of genetic and potentially environmental risk factors, characteristic of a multifactorial disorder.

A few key points support this:

1. The study measured RANKL levels in the culture medium of osteoblasts using ELISA, indicating RANKL is secreted into the medium.

2. Table II shows RANKL levels detected in the culture medium of osteoblasts in both single-culture and co-culture conditions. 

3. The text states ""The OPG/RANKL ratio secreted by co-cultured osteoblasts compared with single-cultured was identified by ELISA analysis of cell culture medium"".

4. It mentions that ""adipocyte-secreted cytokines affected the OPG/RANKL/RANK trail system"", implying RANKL is part of a secreted system.

5. The study discusses the balance of secreted OPG/RANKL as an important mechanism regulating bone metabolism.

So in summary, yes, the context indicates that RANKL is secreted from cells, particularly osteoblasts, into the extracellular environment where it can interact with its receptor RANK on other cells like osteoclasts. The ability to detect and measure RANKL in the culture medium demonstrates it is a secreted factor.",correct,correct

Potential benefits:

1. HER2 is overexpressed in 20-30% of prostate cancers and up to 78% of androgen-independent prostate cancers, suggesting it could be a promising target.

2. Preclinical studies showed some efficacy:
- Trastuzumab reduced tumor growth by 60-80% in a mouse model of prostate cancer. 
- It was effective in androgen-independent tumor xenografts when combined with paclitaxel.

3. HER2 contributes to prostate cancer progression and androgen independence, so targeting it could be beneficial.

Limitations:

1. Clinical trials with trastuzumab as a single agent showed poor efficacy in treating hormone-refractory prostate cancer. 

2. Several clinical trials failed to show benefits using trastuzumab or other HER2-targeting agents for prostate cancer.

3. Prostate cancers often express lower levels of HER2 compared to breast cancers, potentially limiting efficacy.

4. Lack of patient selection based on HER2 expression levels may have contributed to clinical trial failures.

In conclusion, while there is a rationale for targeting HER2 in prostate cancer, clinical results with trastuzumab have been disappointing so far. More research is needed, potentially with improved patient selection or combination therapies, before trastuzumab can be considered a viable treatment option for prostate cancer. The context suggests exploring alternative HER2-targeting approaches may be more promising.",correct,correct

",Run `gradio run.py` in the terminal.,"To run a Gradio Blocks app in reload mode using a Python IDE, you can follow these steps:

1. Save your Gradio app code in a Python file (e.g. run.py)

2. Instead of running the file with the regular Python command, use the ""gradio"" command:

   ```
   gradio run.py
   ```

3. This will run the app in reload mode, where Gradio will watch for changes to the file and automatically reload the app when changes are detected.

Key points:

- Use the ""gradio"" command instead of ""python"" to run the file
- Gradio will watch the directory containing the file for changes
- The app will automatically reload when the file is modified
- By default, Gradio looks for a Blocks/Interface demo called ""demo"" in your code
- If your demo has a different name, you can specify it as the second argument:
  ```
  gradio run.py my_demo
  ```
- You can pass command line arguments to your app as well

This reload mode allows you to make changes to your Gradio app code and see the updates immediately without having to manually stop and restart the app each time.",correct,correct

2. LncRNA exons had dramatically lower coSI (co-transcriptional splicing index) values compared to coding exons in the chromatin fraction, indicating less efficient co-transcriptional splicing.

3. The difference in splicing efficiency between lncRNAs and mRNAs persisted even in the nuclear polyA+ fraction, further supporting that lncRNAs are spliced later or less efficiently.

2. It mentions that both rare variants (RVs) and common variants (CVs) in the RET gene contribute to HSCR risk in a multifactorial manner.

- The FNet model ""replaces the self-attention layer in a BERT model with a fourier transform which returns only the real parts of the transform.""

- This replacement of self-attention with a Fourier transform allows the FNet model to be significantly faster than BERT, with fewer parameters and more memory efficiency.

- The context states that ""replacing the self-attention sublayer in a Transformer encoder with a standard, unparameterized Fourier Transform achieves 92-97% of the accuracy of BERT counterparts on the GLUE benchmark, but trains 80% faster on GPUs and 70% faster on TPUs at standard 512 input lengths.""

Specifically:

1. Clinical trials using Trastuzumab alone for prostate cancer have failed to demonstrate efficacy. The context states: ""clinical trials concerning the treatment of prostate cancer with trastuzumab or lapatinib have failed to demonstrate their efficacy"".

2. While HER2 is overexpressed in some metastatic prostate cancers (42% of tested patients were positive), Trastuzumab was found to be ineffective as a single agent for these patients.

Key points:

1. HER2 is overexpressed in 20-30% of prostate cancers and up to 78% of androgen-independent prostate cancers. Increased HER2 expression is associated with more aggressive disease and progression to androgen independence.

2. Preclinical studies in animal models using trastuzumab alone showed limited therapeutic responses against prostate cancer.

3. Clinical trials using trastuzumab as a single agent in patients with hormone-refractory prostate cancer demonstrated no significant antitumor activity, even in hormone therapy-naive patients. 

4. However, one study showed that combining trastuzumab with docetaxel improved response in prostate cancer xenografts compared to docetaxel alone. The combination led to degradation of androgen receptor and HSP90 proteins.

5. Some researchers are exploring using trastuzumab conjugated to radioactive isotopes like lead-212 as a potential therapy for advanced prostate cancer, with promising early results in animal models.

In summary, while HER2 appears to play a role in prostate cancer progression, trastuzumab alone has not shown significant efficacy in clinical trials.

1. HER2 expression increases in prostate cancer as it progresses to androgen independence, suggesting HER2 may be a potential target.

2. HER2 can activate the androgen receptor pathway even without androgen, indicating it may play a role in androgen-independent prostate cancer.

3. Several studies have evaluated Trastuzumab for prostate cancer:

- Preclinical studies in animal models showed limited therapeutic responses to Trastuzumab alone.

- A phase II clinical trial found Trastuzumab was well-tolerated but demonstrated no significant antitumor activity in hormone therapy-naive patients.

- Another study noted that prostate tumors with high HER2 expression were found to be resistant or much less sensitive to Trastuzumab treatment compared to breast cancer.

4. However, some potential remains:

- Combining Trastuzumab with other therapies may improve efficacy. 

- Using Trastuzumab conjugated to radionuclides or toxins could potentially enhance its effects against prostate cancer.

In summary, while Trastuzumab alone has shown limited efficacy against prostate cancer so far, it may still have potential use as part of combination therapies or when modified (e.g. radiolabeled).

Key points that support this:

1. The article states that HSCR has a ""complex genetic etiology with several genes being described as associated with either isolated or syndromic forms.""

2. It mentions that HSCR has ""differential contributions of its rare and common, coding and noncoding mutations to the multifactorial nature of this pathology.""

3. The study found that both rare variants (RVs) and common variants (CVs) in the RET gene contribute to HSCR risk, suggesting multiple genetic factors are involved.

4. The authors describe an ""additive/multiplicative model"" for HSCR, indicating multiple genes/variants interact to produce the phenotype. 

5. They found that in many cases, patients had both a rare coding variant and a common noncoding variant in RET, acting synergistically.

7. The complex inheritance pattern, involving multiple genes and both rare and common variants, is more consistent with a multifactorial disorder than a simple Mendelian condition.

In summary, while certain rare mutations may cause Mendelian forms in some families, the overall evidence indicates HSCR is primarily a multifactorial disorder with complex genetic architecture involving multiple genes and variants.",partially,partially_correct

",By passing `fp16=True` to the Accelerator init.,"To force mixed precision training when initializing the Accelerator in 🤗 Accelerate, you can pass the `mixed_precision` parameter to the Accelerator constructor. Specifically:

```python
from accelerate import Accelerator

accelerator = Accelerator(mixed_precision='fp16')
```

This will enable mixed precision training using 16-bit floating point (FP16).

If you want to use bfloat16 instead, you can do:

```python 
accelerator = Accelerator(mixed_precision='bf16')
```

The options for `mixed_precision` are:

- 'no': No mixed precision (default)
- 'fp16': 16-bit floating point mixed precision
- 'bf16': bfloat16 mixed precision

So by explicitly specifying 'fp16' or 'bf16', you can force mixed precision training when initializing the Accelerator.

You can also set this via environment variables or command line arguments when launching your script with the accelerate CLI. But passing it directly to the Accelerator constructor gives you the most control within your code.",correct,correct

",Run `gradio run.py` in the terminal.,"To run a Gradio Blocks app in reload mode using a Python IDE, you can follow these steps:

1. Save your Gradio app code in a Python file, for example `run.py`.

2. Instead of running the file with `python run.py`, use the `gradio` command in the terminal:

   ```
   gradio run.py
   ```

3. This will run the app in reload mode, where Gradio will watch for changes to the file and automatically reload the app when you save changes.

4. Make sure your Blocks app is named `demo` in your code, or pass the name as a second argument:

   ```
   gradio run.py my_demo
   ```

   If your app is named something other than `demo`.

5. You can now edit your code in the IDE, save changes, and see the app reload automatically in the browser without having to restart it manually.

Some key points:

- The `gradio` command enables auto-reloading
- It watches the directory containing your Python file for changes
- You don't need to call `launch()` in your code when using reload mode
- It looks for a Blocks/Interface object named `demo` by default
- You can pass command line arguments to your app after the filename

This allows for faster development as you can quickly iterate on your Gradio app without having to manually restart it each time you make changes.",correct,correct

",Run `gradio run.py` in the terminal.,"To run a Gradio Blocks app in reload mode using a Python IDE, you can follow these steps:

1. Save your Gradio Blocks code in a Python file, for example `run.py`.

2. Instead of running the file with `python run.py`, use the `gradio` command in the terminal:

   ```
   gradio run.py
   ```

3. This will run your app in reload mode, which means Gradio will watch for changes to your file and automatically reload the app when you save changes.

Key points to remember:

- Your Blocks app should be named `demo` by default. If you use a different name, you need to specify it when running, e.g. `gradio run.py my_demo`.

- The `gradio` command looks for a Gradio Blocks or Interface demo called `demo` in your code.

- In reload mode, Gradio watches the directory where your Python file is located and will automatically rerun the file if it detects changes.

- This allows you to make changes to your code and see them reflected in the app immediately without having to manually stop and restart the server.

- The reload mode is particularly useful when developing and iterating on your Gradio app in a Python IDE.

Specifically:

1. Most lncRNAs are spliced (98%), but they tend to have fewer exons than protein-coding genes - 42% of lncRNA transcripts have only two exons, compared to 6% of protein-coding genes.

2. Over 25% of lncRNA genes show evidence of alternative splicing, with at least two different transcript isoforms per gene locus.

3. The vast majority of lncRNA introns are flanked by canonical splice sites (GT/AG), similar to protein-coding genes.

4. However, lncRNAs show lower splicing completion rates compared to mRNAs, both at the exon level and gene level, in chromatin-associated RNA fractions. This suggests lncRNAs are often spliced later or sometimes might not be spliced at all.

5. Some well-known lncRNAs like AIRN and KCNQ1OT1 are reported to remain predominantly unspliced.

6. The authors suggest that for many lncRNAs, either they remain completely unspliced, or a high proportion of primary transcripts are never spliced while a minority are processed by the splicing machinery.

In summary, while most lncRNAs do undergo splicing, they tend to be spliced less efficiently and extensively compared to mRNAs, with some lncRNAs potentially remaining unspliced. The splicing dynamics of lncRNAs appear to be more variable than those of protein-coding genes.",correct,correct

Key points that support this:

1. The context states that HSCR has a ""complex genetic etiology with several genes being described as associated with either isolated or syndromic forms.""

2. It mentions that both rare variants (RVs) and common variants (CVs) in the RET gene contribute to HSCR risk in a multifactorial way.

3. The study found that RET common variants and rare variants ""seem to act in a synergistic way leading to HSCR phenotype.""

4. The authors refer to an ""additive/multiplicative model proposed for HSCR"", suggesting multiple genetic factors contribute.

6. The disease shows incomplete penetrance and variable expressivity, which is characteristic of multifactorial disorders.

7. Environmental factors are also thought to play a role, as evidenced by the gender differences observed.

In summary, while RET is a major gene involved, HSCR appears to result from a combination of multiple genetic and environmental factors, fitting the profile of a complex multifactorial disorder rather than a single-gene Mendelian condition.

1. HER2, the target of trastuzumab, is overexpressed in approximately 20-30% of prostate cancers and in 78% of androgen-independent prostate cancers. It is preferentially expressed in hormone-refractory and metastatic prostate cancers.

2. Increased HER2 expression correlates with more aggressive tumor behavior and is associated with prostate cancer progression.

3. HER2 contributes to prostate cancer progression through multiple mechanisms, including stimulating tumor cell proliferation, stabilizing the androgen receptor, and activating signaling pathways. 

4. Preclinical studies have shown that targeting HER2 can inhibit growth of prostate cancer cells.

5. The study described in the abstract found that 212Pb-trastuzumab (a radioactive form of trastuzumab) reduced tumor growth by 60-80%, reduced metastasis, and prolonged survival in a mouse model of prostate cancer.

1. miR-200a
2. miR-200b  
3. miR-200c
4. miR-141
5. miR-100

Specifically:

- miR-200a, miR-200b, miR-200c, and miR-141 were consistently up-regulated in EOC in multiple studies. These all belong to the miR-200 family.

- miR-100 was consistently down-regulated in EOC in multiple studies.

- In serum samples, miR-200a, miR-200b and miR-200c levels were significantly higher in EOC patients compared to healthy controls. 

- The combination of miR-200b + miR-200c normalized to serum volume and miR-103 was found to be the best predictive classifier of serous EOC.

- miR-103 was identified as a potential endogenous normalizer for serum miRNA measurements.

So in summary, members of the miR-200 family (especially miR-200b and miR-200c) appear to be the most promising potential biomarkers for EOC based on the evidence presented. miR-100 may also have potential as a down-regulated biomarker.

",Run `gradio run.py` in the terminal.,"To run a Gradio Blocks app in reload mode using a Python IDE, you can follow these steps:

1. Save your Gradio app code in a Python file, for example `run.py`.

2. Make sure your Blocks app is named `demo`. For example:

```python
import gradio as gr

with gr.Blocks() as demo:
    # Your Gradio app code here
    
if __name__ == ""__main__"":
    demo.launch()
```

3. Open a terminal and navigate to the directory containing your `run.py` file.

4. Instead of running `python run.py`, use the `gradio` command:

```
gradio run.py
```

This will run your app in reload mode. Gradio will watch for changes to your `run.py` file and automatically reload the app when you save changes.

Key points:

- Use the `gradio` command instead of `python` to run the file
- Your Blocks app should be named `demo` by default
- If you named your app something else, you can specify it like: `gradio run.py my_demo_name`
- Gradio will watch for file changes and auto-reload the app
- This allows you to quickly iterate on your app without manually restarting it

","FSDP is developed for distributed training of large pretrained models up to 1T parameters by sharding the model parameters, gradients, and optimizer states across data parallel processes.","Fully Sharded Data Parallel (FSDP) is a technique developed for distributed training of large pretrained models, with the following key purposes:

1. To enable training of very large models (up to 1 trillion parameters) that would not fit on a single GPU.

2. To shard (split up) the model parameters, gradients, and optimizer states across multiple GPUs/processes. This allows scaling to larger model sizes.

3. To improve memory efficiency by only keeping a portion of the model on each GPU, rather than replicating the full model.

4. To optionally offload sharded model parameters to CPU memory, further reducing GPU memory usage.

5. To allow scaling training to larger batch sizes or model sizes than would be possible with standard data parallel approaches.

6. To maintain similar performance and convergence characteristics as data parallel training while enabling much larger models.

Some key points about FSDP:

- It shards model parameters, gradients and optimizer states across processes, unlike regular data parallel which replicates the full model.

- It can offload parameters to CPU to further reduce GPU memory usage.

- It allows training models that are too large to fit on a single GPU.

- It aims to be more memory efficient than other distributed training approaches for very large models.

- It is designed to work with minimal changes to existing PyTorch training code.
